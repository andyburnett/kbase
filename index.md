## now what do we do

These recommendations are offered on the basis of our extensive experience running innovation workshops. However, the specific requirements for each event will be defined together with your event’s project manager, so please treat these recommendations as broad [guidelines](/venue).

We run dynamic, immersive events. We might go through a thousand post-it notes and draw giant diagrams. In order to do that, we post rolls of white paper up on the walls with painters tape, use lots of flip charts with easels, and utilize space by moving chairs and tables on occasion.

Here’s​ a video to give you an idea of what we mean. Most hotels are okay with it, but some aren’t. It is a deal breaker for us, so we want to be sure it is prioritized when considering venues

### Meeting Rooms
  * A large main meeting room space with plenty of room to move around. A good rule of thumb: it should be twice the size necessary to seat everyone at small round tables. For instance, you need 1800-2200 square feet for a workshop of 25-30 participants
  * Carpeting on the floor to absorb sound.
